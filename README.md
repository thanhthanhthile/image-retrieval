## Introduction
This is my Image Retrieval system which apply the knowledge that I have learned from MIR course in UIT.

The user enters a query(a string or an image) into the system and the number of retrieved images. The system compute a numeric score on how well each object (caption/image) in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user.

## Dataset
The dataset is [Validation set in Visual Question Answering - VizWiz](https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/vqa/), includes 5108 images and captions.
