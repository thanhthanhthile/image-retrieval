Panasonic microwave panel including buttons for power level, time and other options
Panasonic microwave with LED numbers blank and description "800W High Power" that has 3 top buttons of "Popcorn", "Auto Reheat" and "Auto Cook" a big middle button that says to left of it "Time" and to right of it "Serving Weight" then another 3 buttons below that saying "Power Level", "Auto Defrost", "Quick Min" with the very bottom having 2 buttons "Timer/More" and "Clock/Less".
The side of a microwave or toaster oven.

I am looking at the side of a microwave that has all of the buttons and functions in order to use the microwave.
