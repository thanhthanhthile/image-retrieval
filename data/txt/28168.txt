I see a box of food called sausages and gravy
Two frozen meals the top is savory beef rissoles and the lower is sausages and onion gravy
Two packages of TV dinners, one is beef and one is sausage.
Two microwaveable dinners; top is Savory Beef Rissoles, bottom is Sausages & Onion Gravy.
A picture of the food is on the packaging.
