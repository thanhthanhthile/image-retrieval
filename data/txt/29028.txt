A TV remote control has the power button at the top right corner, below it there is a horizontal line of buttons with the far left button labeled "TV", below those there is a circle, below that there are two long buttons side by side with the one on the right labeled channel and the one on the left labeled volume with each button being able to be pushed at the top and bottom to increase or decrease.
