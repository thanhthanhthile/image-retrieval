A variety of clothing patches that say, Media, Staff and LAPTOP
Here is a light green board that's sitting on a black table, the board has two black rectangular sewn patches that have red hearts (like the queen of hearts playing card) with white stars in the middle (one patch says media and the other says staff), there is part of a patch that reads laptop, and there is a black briefcase sitting behind the table in the background.
Four woven patch insignias are laid out on a mat on a table.
A black bag is placed next to a black round table.
A display of various patches, one of which is a zebra print heart with it's center cut out and filled with colorful squares, two are red spades with silver stars in the center on a black background, each has a different word with one reading "media" and the other as "staff"
