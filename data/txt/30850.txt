Some windows on a computer talking about image backup.
Beautiful view from behind the walls hidden under dark mist
A computer monitor is showing a POP UP on the screen.
Close look at a computer monitor's screen which displays a message about restoring the system with an image file, but Windows cannot find a system image on this pc, and it will require a backup DVD to restore the pc.
