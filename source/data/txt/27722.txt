A plastic microwaveable container with ready to eat food with a directions label.
Brightly colored packaging from a laundry product and part of a green plastic lid, sitting on a wooden desk next to a printer.
I see the back of product packaging with instructions for cooking.
A microwavable entree is on top of a table.
