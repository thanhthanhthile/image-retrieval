a TV or computer with a loading bar on it
A laptop screen has a Microsoft logo of loading on it.
The bottom of a computer screen with something loading, and Microsoft across it
A large screen that is powered on is only able to show a white line across the middle and the Microsoft Corporation logo on the bottom right hand side.
I see a computer monitor with a black screen and white letters.
